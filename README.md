# This is Youtube Skeleton Channel app for iOS to make stand-alone app for any channel

I am using some channels from Youtube from Pakistan with their consent.

* This app is using **YoutubeV3 API** to parse the channel in form of JSON.
* You have to make your own **API Key** and use that in this app.
* This app uses skeleton loading view to make UX better. It still needs some improvement which will be coming in future.
* You are totally welcome to make some improvements.
